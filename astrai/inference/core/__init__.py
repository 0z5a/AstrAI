"""Core layer (vLLM: EngineCore process — scheduler + KV accounting).

Single-writer request lifecycle: waiting/running queues, the busy loop,
step scheduling, KV cache management and the policy-version protocol for
weights shared with the trainer.  The core emits output events; it never
detokenizes and never runs consumer callbacks.
