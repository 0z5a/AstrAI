"""Output events: the single event contract between core and frontend.

Mirrors vLLM v1's frontend/core split: the scheduler loop emits token IDs
and terminal facts only — never user callbacks, never text rendering.  The
frontend (engine + protocol adapters) consumes these events, detokenizes,
maps finish reasons and builds protocol responses.

Lifecycle: every request ends with exactly one terminal event
(``RequestFinished`` or ``RequestError``); terminal events are emitted
after all of the request's ``TokenDelta`` events.  Consumers may rely on
that ordering to release per-request state.
