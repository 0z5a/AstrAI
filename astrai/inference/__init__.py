"""Inference module for continuous batching, in three layers.

Layering (mirrors vLLM v1's process topology, in-process):

- ``frontend/``  user-facing: engine facade, input/output processors,
                 output events, engine-core client seam   (vLLM: API proc)
- ``core/``      engine core: scheduler, request lifecycle, stepper,
                 KV cache accounting, policy versioning   (vLLM: EngineCore)
- ``worker/``    model execution: model runner, pending steps, CUDA
                 graphs, sampler, workspace                (vLLM: Worker)
- ``network/``   HTTP protocol adapters (OpenAI/Anthropic) — part of the
                 frontend deployment, kept as its own package.

Dependency rule (one-way): frontend → core → worker → model/KV ABI.
